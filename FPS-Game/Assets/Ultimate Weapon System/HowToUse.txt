Note: It is best to see the example weapon(s) to best understand how it is used.

*Weapon Motions(optional): For having weapon motion, you must create an empty GameObject that is not affected by any scripts, and
 attach all weapons to it. The motion system is in the 'WeaponSwitcher' script and is completely optional.

*Draw and Holster Animations: A separate GameObject must be created, and attached to the 'Weapon Motion' GameObject, and then attach
 all the weapons you have onto it.

*Weapon Body: For the main weapon body, create an empty GameObject and add the UltimateWeaponSystem script onto it. (optional)Then create your
 empty GameObject and attach it to the main body object. This is if you will be using aim down sigts.
 After that add your weapon model with it's animations as a child to the last child object in the setup. Note that you must assign all your objects
 as targets to the required variables in the UWS script.
 All variables in the inspector have tooltips in the inspector for better understanding.

*Fire Position(optional): By default the fire position that the projectile or raycast will be fired from is the object that has the attached UWS script,
 towards the forward direction, but you can manually set multiple fire positions of the weapon both as in a list or random firing order(check script tooltip
 for more information).

*UI(optional): The script uses the new uGUI introduced in Unity 4.6 and everything is optional do add. In order for it to work properly, make sure the
 group of objects you have assigned to the UWS script will always be alongside with the UI objects(this means that nothing gets destroyed or instantiated
 or the setup will be destroyed). It is recommended that you parent the UI to the weapon you will be using with that UI to avoid such situations.

*You can have a large variety of weapon combinations, from fire rate, and burst fire amounts - to complex animation cycles
 for reloading your weapon, while keeping performance cost to the minimum.
 All properties of the UWS script have tooltips to help accomplish these combinations, with little effort!
